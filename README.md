# Covid-Appointment-Finder

this is a very basic application to find available appointment from stamford hospital in Connecticut.
We can use the same scenraio and do the same for other vaccination places like VAMS... 
everything defined as static information, due to limited time. I will expand it later on..

Usage:
Just add a new scheduler in yoir windows to run python script.
you can find the python installation path on your computer by typing "where python" in CMD
Then simply copy the path and add it in the scheduler script. 
In add arument just copy the python filename for Ex. scrapper.py and in the start in put the location path to your python file...
that's it...
whenever the system found any appointment available, it will buzz you by making a load sound and then you can schedule for appointment by yourself...

Please be aware that we use timer to in between to manage the delay for openning the page and also to act like human...:) not detecting as bot

Enjoy!
